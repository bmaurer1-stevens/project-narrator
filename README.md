Final Project for EE 608: Optimizing Audiobook Production from Text
1. Problem Description
Automating the production of audiobooks from text involves using advanced text-to-speech (TTS) technology to convert written content into spoken audio. The goal is to mimic human narrators as closely as possible, enhancing the listener's experience by making synthetic narration sound natural and engaging.

2. Optimization Model
The optimization model would involve:

Text Analysis: Parsing and understanding the text to identify emotional cues, sentence structures, and context to determine the appropriate tone and inflection.
Speech Synthesis: Generating speech from text using a TTS engine, optimizing for naturalness, clarity, and expressiveness.
Parameter Tuning: Adjusting parameters like speed, pitch, volume, and pauses based on the context and content of the text.
3. Data Sources
Several publicly available datasets can be utilized for training and testing the TTS models:

LibriSpeech: A corpus of read English speech designed for research in automatic speech recognition and understanding, derived from audiobooks.
VCTK Corpus: Contains speech data uttered by 110 English speakers with various accents, useful for training voice models.
TIMIT: Includes a wide range of phonetic sounds produced in different contexts, useful for phonetic and phonological analysis and improving pronunciation models.
Common Voice by Mozilla: A multilingual dataset of voices from volunteers around the world, useful for diversifying the accents and styles in speech synthesis.
4. Program Structure

Pre-processing Module: Analyzes the text for structure, punctuation, and semantic content to guide the synthesis process.
Synthesis Engine: Utilizes a TTS system possibly based on neural networks like Tacotron or FastSpeech that converts processed text into spoken word, applying learned parameters for voice modulation.
Post-processing Module: Refines the audio output, adjusting any mismatches in tone or unnatural pauses, and enhances clarity.
Evaluation System: Uses both automated and human-based methods to evaluate the quality of the audiobook productions.
5. Performance Metrics
Besides manual examination by human listeners, several automated metrics can be used to evaluate performance:

Mean Opinion Score (MOS): Traditionally used in telecommunications to assess the quality of voice coding and transmission. In this context, it measures the naturalness and clarity of the synthesized speech.
Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ): An ITU standard for automated assessment of voice quality, originally designed for telephone networks and VoIP systems.
Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER): Used to measure the accuracy of speech recognition systems but can be adapted to evaluate how accurately the speech synthesis matches intended outputs.
Subjective Listening Tests: Involving target audience members rating the quality of the audiobook samples on various factors like enjoyment, engagement, and listening fatigue.
6. Implementation Challenges

Handling diverse literary styles and genres that require different tones and pacing.
Emotional and contextual variability in texts, which are challenging to interpret and render accurately in speech.
Maintaining listener engagement over long periods typical of audiobooks, especially with synthesized voices.
By addressing these challenges and optimizing across the specified modules, the project aims to significantly advance the automation of audiobook production, making it more scalable and accessible to a broader range of content creators and audiences.
